				<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
					<p>Be able to send a A4 sized paper or smaller and sent it 
					through air. Paper must arrive in a neat fashion. Must have
					accuracy and sometimes distance. Must all be automated</p>
				<h3>Phase 1</h3>
				<h4>Design 1</h4>
					<p>Using a paper airplane to shoot the message through air</p>
					<img src="img/plane_how10.jpg" alt="Paper Plane" id="blogImg">
					<p>Using the paper plane instruction for <a href="paper_plane.html">
					"Flat Head"</a> we made a paper plane for message transportation.</p>
					<p>During first testing, we realised that the airplane design actually 
					made it pitched too high. So, we weight the front of the paper plane using
					metal paper clip</p>
					<img src="img/plane_v2.jpg" alt="Modified Paper Plane" id="blogImg">
					<p>With this it can fly nice and straight</p>
				<h4>Design 2</h4>
					<p>Shooting a bullet like object through the air to send the message</p>
					<p>For this, we thought of the weapon of choice that we use to use during our secondary school
					time, a thickly folded paper propelled using rubber band normally used to cause our peers to be 
					in deep pain and hatred towards us. However, we think this idea could be useful for tranferring the
					message through the air as it should have enough force to cut through the air(since it can harm human too)</p>

				<h4>Design 3</h4>
					<p>Using a glider to carry the message through the air</p>
					<img src="img/gliderV1.jpg" alt="glider version one" id="blogImg">
					<p>This is our very first design on glider to see how it would fly, it is just
					a very simple design with no planning at all. We just want to try whether a glider shape
					using paper and popsicle stick could be used</p>
					<p>After testing, it failed horribly but decided that with a better planning and design, 
					the glider should be able to send our message through the air</p>

				<h4> Launcher Design</h4>
					<p>After coming up with some medium that we can use to hold our 
					messages, we start coming up with design for our launcher</p>
					<p>Since we need to have either accuracy or distance, we design our
					launcher to have its launching mechanism variable so we can 
					vary the speed and we intent to have a dual-axis servo control 
					so we could launch it anywhere we want.</p>
					<img src="img/launcher_top.jpg" alt="Top-down view of launcher" id="blogImg">
					<img src="img/launcher_side.jpg" alt="Side view of launcher" id="blogImg">
					<p>This will be the physical frame of the launcher</p>
					<p>We then procced to build it using cardboard</p>
					<img src="img/frame v1.jpg" alt="Launcher Frame" id="blogImg">
					<p>We stick the two motor with tape and for the launcher head. We
					used two bottle cap and superglued a cut up rubber band for some friction</p>
					<img src="img/launcher_head1.jpg" alt="Launcher Head" id="blogImg">
				<h4>Launcher Electronics</h4>
					<p>With the design to achieve both distance and accuracy, we figured
					out that we will need 2 DC motor for the launching the projectile and
					2 servo to control the 2-axis tilt of the launcher. The launcher must be
					automated so we will have 3 buttons each with its own instruction to 
					shoot straight, left, and right.</p>
				<h5>Button</h5>
					<img src="img/button_design.jpg" alt="Button Design" id="blogImg">
					<p>We will be using a pull-down resistor to make the button interface
					with the Arduino. This circuit will send a logic LOW (0V) when the button
					is not pushed and a logic HIGH (5V) when the button is pushed</p>
				<h5>Dual Motor Launcher</h5>
					<img src="img/motor_design.jpg" alt="Motor Design" id="blogImg">
					<p>We will connect the motor using NPN Transistor to use as a switch and an amplifier so
					that we can use the output I/O in our Arduino to control the motor. We have also chosen to
					use the PWM to adjust the speed of the motor for better accuracy</p>
					<p>Finally, we add the servo motor that will control the direction of our launch</p>
					<p>We simulate it using Tinker CAD and it works!</p>
					<!--<img src="img/simulation1.jpg" alt="First Simulation" id="blogImg">-->
					<img src="img/simulation2.jpg" alt="Second Simulation" id="blogImg">
					<p>With that all the electronic components are working</p>
					<p>Note: all the ground connection needs to be connected together to have a "common ground".
					If this is not done, the circuit might not work</p>
				<h4>Testing</h4>
					<p>After connecting everything together, we start our first testing</p>
					<img src="img/launcher_testing1.jpg" alt="Testing 1" id="blogImg">
					<p>The dual motor works and so we procced with the servo mount</p>
				<h4>Launcher Base</h4>
					<p>We then procced to make the base of out launcher.
					This is how we plan our launcher to be mounted to the servo, with
					a 45 degree tilt</p>
					<img src="img/launcher_mount_height.jpg" alt="Servo mount height" id="blogImg">
					<p>After doing math we then made it out and tested it</p>
					<img src="img/testing2.jpg" alt="Test 2" id="blogImg">
					<p>We found out that it flies high, but not very far. From the feedback 
					of our lecturer, we did more testing with different angle and found out that 
					30 degree will be optimal</p>
					<p>After that,we design the base where the servo and the launcher is going
					to sit so that we can turn the launcher in whatever angle we pleases</p>
					<img src="img/base_design.jpg" alt="base design" id="blogImg">
					<p>The design will use a servo to turn a belt that is wrap around the base
					of the launcher that is 3D printed.</p>
					<p>STL file: <a href="resources/ball_bearing_adapter.stl">Ball Bearing Adapter</a></p>
					<img src="img/adapter1.jpg" alt="Ball bearing adapter" id="blogImg">
					<p>Then, we begin construction</p>
					<img src="img/belt_testing.jpg" alt="Belt testing picture" id="blogImg">
					<p>When we are done making it, we tested the turning mechanism....
					Turns out (pun totally not intended) the belt did not have enough 
					tension to turn the base of the launcher</p>
					<p>Plan B, we were too tired to thing of ingenious engineering idea to turn the launcher,
					so we just super glued the base of the launcher to the servo and call it a day.</p>
					<src img="img/final_base.jpg" alt="Final Base" id="blogImg">
				<h4>Testing 2</h4>
					<p>And.... it works... yay...!</p>
					<p>With that, all our components are working and the servo manages to turn the entire
					launcher with alot of woobling but hey, it works!</p>
					<p>This is all the progress and steps
					that we took to reach here so congratulation for reading up till here...
					Here is a picture of happy Tristan for you :D</p>
					<img src="img/happy_tristan.jpg" alt="Happy pic" id="blogImg">
					<p>However, as with any other good engineers, we have our own share of feature creeping along the way.
					So beyond this point are stuff that are not essential for the project but we still did it for the fun of it.</p>
					<p>But before that, we made a few adjusment to previous decision to make our launcher more stable.</p>
				<h4>Adjustment</h4>
					<p>Firstly, we did not want to use plain <i>URGHH...</i> buttons to control our system, we wanted it to use 
					a computer interface kind of system to control it. So we threw away the buttons</p>
					<img src="img/simulation3.jpg" alt="Simulation with no button" id="blogImg">
					<p>Secondly, our seniors pointed out that if we want our motor to achieve a higher RPM, we should give it more voltage.
					However, our whole system was design under one power supply that is 5V. Cranking this number to speed up our motor will 
					be disastrous as it is connected in parallel to our servo which could only take 5V. Thus, we split the system to its
					individual circuit using two different power supply such that our servo can have 5V supply, while our motor 7V or higher.</p>
					<img src="img/simulation4.jpg" alt="Simulation with 2 different power source" id="blogImg">
					<p>We also change the transistor that is controlling the motor to a higher resistance one so that we could afford to send 
					a higher current to our motor wihout killing the transistor</p>
				<h4>Feature Creep</h4>
					<h5>Glider</h5>
						<p>The length of what we did just to do this feature was so long that we decide
						that it might as well be its own project. You can find it <a href="glider.html">HERE</a>.</p>
					<h5>Computer Interface</h5>
						<p>For interfacing with the launcher, we want to be able to control both the angle of rotation and speed. Using buttons to do all that
						will not be very convinient, so we decided to make a terminal interface with it. By using Arduino's own Serial command, we wrote our 
						code to be able to accept commands from the Serial.</p>
						<p>Computer interface source code: <a href="resources\Plane_Launcher_final\Plane_Launcher_final.ino">HERE</a></p>
						<p>Button interface source code: <a href="resources\Plane_Launcher\Plane_Launcher.ino">HERE</a></p>
						<p>Note: Launching Motor must be connected to pin 5 and 6. Servo must be connected to pin 11</p>
						<p>Button connected to pin 8, 9, and 10.</p>
				<h4>Final Prototype</h4>
					<img src="img/final_product.jpg" alt="Final Product" id="blogImg">
					<p>Videos of our prototype</p>
					<img src="img/turning.gif" alt="Turning GIF" id="blogImg">
					<img src="img/launching.gif" alt="Launching GIF" id="blogImg">
					<p>During the demo, the launcher manage to only launch the paper airplane to about 1 meter. Compared
					to the other design, it is safe to say that ours achieved the shortest distance. The cause for it was 
					that there was too much friction in our cardboard launcher and that the launcher was too heavy and bulky,
					so it was unstable and thus we could not load the paper plane properly. Other than that, our computer interface
					system works pretty well(other than a bug that always make it turn a 180 degree whenever we launch it).</p>
					<p>If given a chance to do it again, we would have used acrylic and made the whole thing smaller.</p>
