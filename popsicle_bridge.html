			<h2>Popsicle Bridge</h2>
			<hr>
				<h4>Resources</h4>
					<p>We are only provided with 2 packet of popsicle sticks and a hot glue gun.</p>

				<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
					<p>To make a bridge out of popsicle stick that will span a length of 30cm and the width of 5cm</p>
				<h4>Design 1</h4>
					<img src="img/bridge_connection.jpg" id="blogImg" alt="bride connection">
					<p>We found out that by letting the popsicle lay on its side, 
					we found out that it is stronger. We will call this structure the interlocking popsicle</p>
					<p>Using this design idea, we procced to continue building the 
					bridge by continuing the above structure and having two interlocking popsicle 
					parallel to each other. After that we add a few supporting structures 
					between the two interlocking popsicle</p>
					<p>and... we are done!</p>

					<p>The award winning bridge stucture made of popsicle!!!
					<br>With that we are ready for the competition</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>.</p>
					<p>.</p>
				<h4>Conclusion</h4>
					<p>After holding onto the pressure of life(metal tools) on its back for too much</p>
					<p>It finally broke</p>
					<img src="img/broken_bridge.jpg" alt="Broken bridge" id="blogImg">
					<p>The bridge was able to whitstand the weight of 6 hammers, 2 claw hammers, and some other metal tools before breaking.</p>
					<p>Looking at the bridge we can see where the weak point was on the bridge</p>
					<img src="img/broken_part.jpg" alt="Where the bridge broke" id="blogImg">
					<p>It was on one of the interlocking popsicle</p>
					<p>Nevertheless, the bridge supported more weight then what we originally thought it would.</p>
					<p>However, we think we could have done better if we made more than 2 of the interlocking popsicle.
					Funnily enough, the bridge that won the competition was made with the same interlocking popsicle
					system. But rather than just having 2 of them, they made a whole block of it...</p>
