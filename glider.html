			<h2>Flying Paperwork</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4>Resources</h4>
				<p><b>THIS IS A PLACE HOLDER, DONT FORGET ME!!!!</b></p>
				<p>Everything that could be found in EA Fablab</p>
				<h4>Mission Statement</h4>
					<p>Be able to send a A4 sized paper or smaller and sent it 
					through air. Paper must arrive in a neat fashion. Must have
					accuracy and sometimes distance. Must all be automated</p>
				<h3>Phase 1</h3>
				<h4>Design 1</h4>
					<p>Using a paper airplane to shoot the message through air</p>

				<h4>Design 2</h4>
					<p>Shooting a bullet like object through the air to send the message</p>
					<p>For this, we thought of the weapon of choice that we use to use during our secondary school
					time, a thickly folded paper propelled using rubber band normally used to cause our peers to be 
					in deep pain and hatred towards us. However, we think this idea could be useful for tranferring the
					message through the air as it should have enough force to cut through the air(since it can harm human too)</p>

				<h4>Design 3</h4>
					<p>Using a glider to carry the message through the air</p>
					<img src="img/gliderV1.jpg" alt="glider version one" id="blogImg">
					<p>This is our very first design on glider to see how it would fly, it is just
					a very simple design with no planning at all. We just want to try whether a glider shape
					using paper and popsicle stick could be used</p>
					<p>After testing, it failed horribly but decided that with a better planning and design, 
					the glider should be able to send our message through the air</p>
				<h3>Phase 2 - Launcher</h3>
				<h4>Resources</h4>
				<p>2x DC Motor</p>
				<p>2x Servo Motor</p>
				<p>2x Push Button</p>
				<p>1x Arduino Uno</p>
				
				<!-- ADD MORE STUFF LATER ON WHEN USING THEM -->
				
				<p>Wires</p>
				<h4> Launcher Design</h4>
				<p>After coming up with some medium that we can use to hold our 
				messages, we start coming up with design for our launcher</p>
				<p>Since we need to have either accuracy or distance, we design our
				launcher to have its launching mechanism variable so we can 
				vary the speed and we intent to have a dual-axis servo control 
				so we could launch it anywhere we want.</p>
				<img src="img/launcher_top.jpg" alt="Top-down view of launcher" id="blogImg">
				<img src="img/launcher_side.jpg" alt="Side view of launcher" id="blogImg">
				<p>This will be the physical frame of the launcher</p>
				<h4>Launcher Electronics</h4>
				<p>With the design to achieve both distance and accuracy, we figured
				out that we will need 2 DC motor for the launching the projectile and
				2 servo to control the 2-axis tilt of the launcher. The launcher must be
				automated so we will have 3 buttons each with its own instruction to 
				shoot straight, left, and right.</p>
				<h5>Button</h5>
				<img src="img/button_design.jpg" alt="Button Design" id="blogImg">
				<p>We will be using a pull-down resistor to make the button interface
				with the Arduino</p>
				<h5>Dual Motor Launcher</h5>
				<img src="img/motor_design.jpg" alt="Motor Design" id="blogImg">
				<p>We will connect the motor using NPN Transistor to use as a switch and an amplifier so
				that we can use the output I/O in our Arduino to control the motor. We have also chosen to
				use the PWM to adjust the speed of the motor for better accuracy</p>
				<p>Finally, we add the servo motor that will control the direction of our launch</p>
				<p>We simulate it using Tinker CAD and it works!</p>

				<p>With that all the electronic components are working</p>
