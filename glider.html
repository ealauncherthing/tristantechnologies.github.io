			<h2>Glider Development</h2>
				<hr>
				<h4>Resources</h4>

				<p>For glider development, we employed the use of a software
				called XFLR 5. This is a freeware software developed based
			  on the XFOIL code but is capable of simulating viscous effects
				in 3D models by means of an interpolation feature.</p>

				<p>The glider itself was made of materials that were easily
				accessible such as ice cream sticks, straws, A4 sheets of paper
				and also paper clips.</p>

				<h4>Design Objectives</h4>

					<p>The glider had to be able to send a A4 sized paper through
					the air. The Paper must arrive in a neat fashion and must have
					accuracy. Long distance is also a design goal. The launch process
					must be automated.</p>

				<h4>Some Design Considerations</h4>
					<p>Based on the design objectives, we can stipulate some basic
					parameters for the glider. As we would like to have some form
					of long range capability, our design had to have a high CL/CD
					ratio, as well as light weight As we would soon find out, this would be incredibly hard to
					achieve as we had to work with a flat piece of A4 paper.</p>

					<p>Achieving sufficient lift was also a problem in itself due to constrained
					wing area available. The constrained wing area arose as a result of
					the neccessity to launch the glider from an automated launch platform
					which only could impart a certain amount of power. In the event, the
					motors driving the flywheel ran into some power draw issues, and even
					the final design (a paper plane) had problems being launched.</p>

					<p>Finally, as a result of the requirement for accuracy, the glider
					had to be able to mantain both stability in all 3 axes (Longitudinal,
					Directional, Lateral) Unfortunately, we had barely managed to achieve
					any form of longitudinal stability.</p>

				<h4><br>First Design</h4>
					<p>Honestly, this one was the one that was rushed the most. We were rushing
					to get all 3 designs out for the first part of the competition, so this one
					was built out of a small piece of A4 paper, held together by a bunch of tape
					and ice cream sticks. It has an incredibly small wing area, and the tail
					is misplaced relative to the CG. As the person who designed this (Tristan,
					who is writing this segment) has minimal experience in glider design,
					the glider ultimately failed to fly properly, and ended up nose diving to its
					eventual demise on the floor.</p>

					<p>The wing spar was comprised of a few ice cream sticks taped together,
					and the message (which was supposed to also be the wing), was paperclipped
					to the spar. This rather crude design incurred a serious weight penalty
					which had to be resolved in later versions of the glider.</p>

					<h4>Second Design (and how we got there)</h4>
					<p>We decided to try an approach which was not as haphazard as the
					one we used to design the first glider. Thus, when I went home, I
					decided to run some simulations to find a workable glider design. The
					program of choice was XFLR5, since I had played around with it a few
					years back and was decently familiar with the interface. The program
					calculated the vehicle polars, which was useful for determining stability
					as well as general performance. To top it off, there was a nice 3D
					GUI to help visualise the design as well the flow features and force
					vectors.</p>

					<p>Aerodynamic Polars for the model glider</p>

					<p>It took a some trial and error and get a stable model (negative Cm V alpha line)
					I also had to use a thin, symmetrical NACA airfoil to approximate the 'flat plate'
					that was our A4 paper.</p>

					<p>This was actually my first time using this software to produce
					a flyable glider, and there was a good chance that I had forgotten or
					misinterpreted something along the way (<i>And it turns out I completely
					forgot about the weight issue</i>). So when it came to actually constructing
					the glider, we used ice cream sticks and A4 paper again. Some hot glue
					had to be applied to the nose of the glider to  shift the CG to 25% chord.
					Also, I had the conception that using paper clips to attach the 'wing'
					(message) would produce a system where the user could easily remove the
					paper when the glider landed.</p>

					<p>After the first test flight, it was realised that the glider was still
					too heavy to fly, and ended up stalling out of the air, again meeting its
					demise with the floor. On the bright side, if thrown right, this Second
					version of the glider stayed in the air abit longer than the first one
					(which nosed dived the first chance it got), but still this design
					wouldnt fufill the requirements.</p>

				<h4><br>Design 3</h4>

				<p>After the previous 2 designs, it was advised that we use a lighter material
				to cut the weight of the glider down, and to do so, plastic straws were employed.
				So during lunch, I went to grab a handful of straws from the food court
				and when I came back, I force-fitted them together to form the 'fuselage'.
				The wing spar was still made out of ice cream sticks, as we felt the straws
				themsleves might be abit flimsy to hold the 2 paper clips which secured
				paper to the spar. The spar was taped to the fuselage. As we were running short
				on time by then, we had to eyeball the dimensions for this glider. But we
				did attempt sizing similar to the previous one.</p>

				<p>Version 3 of the glider</p>

				<p>Upon test flying it, we realised that this new glider still had a tendency
				to stall out at the end part of its flight, although it could stay in the air
				longer than the first 2 had. Also, when we tried to throw it abit faster
				the glider would corkscrew and roll out of control. This was likely due to
				the fact that the wing spar did not extend to the end of the wing, resulting
				in flutter as the vehicle flew, causing a asymmetrical lift distribution across the wing that
				produced a rolling moment.</p>

				<h4><br>Conclusion</h4>

				<p>Further iterations and testing might have produced a functioning glider (we probably needed to radically overhaul the design),
				but unfortunately due to the lack of time, this could not be accomplished.
				Therefore, we reverted to using a paper airplane which displayed better characteristics
				than all 3 designs we had.
